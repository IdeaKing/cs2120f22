Give a formal definition of the proposition
that for every natural number, n, there's a
natural number, m, that's one more than n.

Answer: Assume n is arbitrary. We're to show that

We start by defining two "enumerated" data types,

Define a function, l2n_ni (short for "letters to

/- #C [5 points] 

Write a brief English-language proof showing that
your function is surjective. You must cite what it
means to be surjective (be mathematically precise).
Hint: You'll have to assume you're given any letter
as input. What you do with that arbitrary value to
complete the proof is the question to answer. Once
you have that, the rest is pretty straightforward.

Answer: 
  Assume that we are given an arbitrary letter A, B, or C.
  We must show that there every element of the output set is
  has a corresponding element in the input set since the
  function is surjective. 

  When given the arbitrary letter A, the function returns the
  number one. When given the arbitrary letter B, the function
  returns the number two. When given the arbitrary letter C,
  the function returns the number three.

  Since every element of the output set has a corresponding
  element in the input set, the function is surjective.

This question tests your understanding of
the induction axiom for natural numbers.

You've learned that there are 2^n possible
"interpretations" of n propositional (i.e.,
Boolean) variables. Now *prove* that this 
is true. We'll help a bit. You fill in the
missing parts. 

1. The property, P, of n, we want to prove 
is that "the number of interpretations of 
a collection of n Boolean variables is 2^n." 

2. What we then want to prove is ‚àÄ n, P n.  

3. What specific proposition do we want
to prove as the "base case" in a proof by
induction? Be mathematically precise.

Answer: 
  **The base case is: P n ‚Üí P 0 (where n = 0).**

4. What specific proposition do we want to
prove as the "inductive case" in a proof by
induction? Be mathematically precise.

Answer: 
  **The inductive case is: P n ‚Üí P (n + 1), where**
  **n is any succesive natural number.**

5. Which expression in your preceding answer
corresponds to the induction hypothesis.

Answer: 
  **(n + 1) is the inductive hypothesis. Smaller proofs**
  **build to larger proofs.**

Prove the following formally, writing

it implements. Then below the formal proof
give an English-language version of it.
If the second half of the proof uses the
same strategy as the first half, you can,
in English, say, "the rest of the proof
uses the same strategy," and be done.

  -- Assume the proposition P and Q

  -- QED
end

/-
Proof. 

  We are to prove the proposition P ‚à® Q ‚Üî Q ‚à® P. To prove 
  a bi-implication, we need to prove the two implications
  from left to right and from right to left. 

  First, we prove P ‚à® Q ‚Üí Q ‚à® P. To prove this implication,
  we assume the proposition P ‚à® Q. Under the assumption
  we perform, we have two cases: one where P is true, and one
  where Q is true. In both cases Q ‚à® P  is true because
  P is true, or Q is true.

  Then we prove Q ‚à® P ‚Üí P ‚à® Q. This follows the same strategy as 
  above. 
  
  We have proven the bi-implication from both sides. QED.

We define a new polymorphic data type, 
tree. A tree is either a "twig" that 
carries a value of some type Œ±; or a 
tree is a "root" that carries a value 
of type Œ± and two "children,"" each 
itself such a tree. The definition is
polymorphic in the sense that values
in the tree can be of any type, Œ±.
